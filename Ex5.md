# Ex.No:5
# Ex.Name: Write a C++ program to display the Employee details using the multiple inheritance constructors . Get the values from the user.

(Create two base classes to display Employee ID  and name. In a multiple inherited derived class, display Employee Designation). Get the values from the user.
(Create two base classes to display Employee ID  and name. In a multiple inherited derived class, display Employee Designation)

## Aim:
To write a C++ program to display the Employee details using the multiple inheritance constructors.

## Algorithm:
1. Start the program.
2. Create base class EmpID with constructor to set employee ID.
3. Create base class EmpName with constructor to set employee name.
4. Create derived class Employee inheriting from both base classes.
5. In derived class constructor, call both base class constructors and set designation.
6. Add function in derived class to display ID, name, and designation.
7. In main(), get ID, name, and designation from user.
8. Create Employee object with input values.
9. Call display function.
10. End the program.

## Program:
```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class base1
{
    public:
        int eid;
        void get1(){
            cin>>eid;
        }
   //write your code here 

};
class base2
{
    public:
        string name,desig;
        
        void get2(){
            cin>>name>>desig;
        }
    //write your code here 
};
class derive1 : public base1, public base2
{
    public:
        void display(){
            cout<<" Employee ID : "<<eid<<endl;
            cout<<" Employee Name : "<<name<<endl;
            cout<<" Employee Designation : "<<desig<<endl;
        }
    //write your code here 
};
int main ()
{
    derive1 obj;
    obj.get1();
    obj.get2();
    obj.display();
 //write your code here 
 return 1;   
}
```

## Output:
<img width="1020" height="397" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-13 205254" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db355508-f318-4569-acad-7086a8261cbd" />

## Result:
The program successfully executed to display the Employee details using the multiple inheritance constructors.
